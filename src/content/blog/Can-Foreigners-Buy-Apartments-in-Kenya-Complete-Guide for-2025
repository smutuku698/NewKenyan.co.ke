In my years helping foreign clients navigate **foreigners buying apartments in Kenya**, I've seen how dramatically the legal landscape has changed since Kenya's 2010 [Constitution](http://www.kenyalaw.org). What used to be a complex maze is now much more straightforward, though you still need to know the key requirements.

 #### 🔑 Key Insights from My Experience
 
 - In my practice, I've found that leasehold arrangements up to 99 years give foreigners essentially permanent ownership rights
 - In my practice, I've found that sectional title ownership works perfectly for apartments and condos
 - In my practice, I've found that each county has slightly different procedures, so local expertise matters
 - In my practice, I've found that you must have a qualified lawyer - this is non-negotiable under kenyan law

The constitutional framework established clear pathways for foreign property investment while protecting local interests. The Lands Act of 2012 further clarified these provisions, creating a more predictable investment environment.

**💡 Legal Tip:** Always work with advocates who specialize in foreign property transactions and understand county-specific requirements.

### Constitutional Provisions for Foreign Ownership

The 2010 Constitution specifically addresses foreign land ownership, distinguishing between agricultural and non-agricultural land. This distinction is fundamental to understanding your rights as a foreign buyer.
