<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3"><strong>Setting Up an eCitizen Account</strong></h3>
<p>First, create an account on the <a href="https://www.ecitizen.go.ke" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eCitizen platform</a>. This portal is the gateway for all government services related to business registration in Kenya, including obtaining your KRA PIN, which is mandatory for all directors and shareholders. You'll need to provide personal details such as your ID number, email, and a phone number.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3"><strong>Reserving Your Company Name</strong></h3>
<p>Once your eCitizen account is active, proceed to reserve your company name through the Business Registration Service. You can submit up to three names in order of preference, with a minimal reservation fee of KES 150. This step is crucial as it confirms the uniqueness of your business name in the Kenyan market. The name reservation and initial business registration steps are now integrated, simplifying the process.</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-3"><strong>Preparing and Submitting Incorporation Documents</strong></h3>
<p>Next, prepare the required documents, including the CR1, CR2, CR8 forms, and the Statement of Nominal Share Capital. These forms are available for download from the eCitizen portal. Ensure you also have digital copies of all directors/shareholders' National IDs or passports, along with their KRA PINs. Foreign nationals must provide certified passport copies and their PIN certificate.</p>
